	Files suffixed with `.ps.gz' are Postscript files compressed with the
gzip utility. Once they are uncompressed, they can be directly printed
on a Postscript printer.

	If you do not have a Postscript printer, you can still look at the
contents of the file with a Postscript previewer. You may want to look at
the ghostscript software, available on this ftp site in /pub/ghost. Ghostscript
allows you to preview Postscript files and to print them on non Postscript
printers.
