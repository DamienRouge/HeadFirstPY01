	This directory tree contains Postscript version of research reports
and theses. Files suffixed with `.ps.gz' are postscript files compressed
with the gzip utility.

	If you don't have gzip on your machine, you can request uncompressed
files. To do so, just ask for the file name, without the `.gz' suffix, e.g.

	ftp> get laforia.94.01.ps
